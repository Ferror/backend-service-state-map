# Backend Service State

The knowledge of service state in organisation is critical from security and developer experience point of view. My work requires such knowledge, but
I was unable to find open source solution for such, that's why I decided to create one.


Components
1. Scraper - fetches the information about service from git repository
2. Backend - prepares data for heatmap and stores information about changes (log)
3. Frontend - generates heatmap
